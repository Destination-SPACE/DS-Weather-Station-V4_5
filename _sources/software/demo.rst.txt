Demo Sketch
===========

The `Demo <https://github.com/Destination-SPACE/DS-Weather-Station-V4_5/blob/main/software/Demo/Demo.ino>`_ sketch is used as an introductory program to most of the features on the weather station. This includes scrollable menus for all sensors.

There is no data recording in this example.

Button Menu
-----------

On the weather station there are 4 buttons, ↑, ↓, ←, →.

The ← and → buttons are used to scroll between the weather menu, air quality menu, and the light menu.
