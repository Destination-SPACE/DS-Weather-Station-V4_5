THe SCD40 CO2 sensor uses photoacoustic non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) technology to measure actual CO2 concentration, unlike the eCO2 measurement on the :ref:`ENS160<ens160>`. This works by measuring the attenuation of an infrared light shining through the gas onto an acoustic transducer. Along with the sample chamber there is a reference nitrogen sample used to compare the CO2 measurement to the known gas. This process works according to Beer-Lambert law which is this attenuation of the gas.

Measuring CO2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Measuring CO2 is another important parameter for indoor and outdoor air quality. Health Canada recommends not exceeding 1000ppm of CO2 in a 24 hour period. A high concentration of CO2 can increase the risk of respiratory symptoms, decreased cognitive function, and neurophysiological symptoms such as headaches, tiredness, and dizziness. The graph below shows different concentrations and what effects one may encounter at that concentration.
