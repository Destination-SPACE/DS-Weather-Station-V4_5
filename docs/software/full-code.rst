Button Menu
-----------

On the weather station there are 4 buttons, ↑, ↓, ←, →.

The ← and → buttons are used to scroll between the weather menu, air quality menu, and the light menu.

The ↑ arrow is used to navigate to the data recording menu. Here you can choose to either start recording data or pause data recording. **data recording is paused by default**. Press the → button to confirm your selection.

The ↓ is used to navigate the data recording menu above. When in either the air quality or light menu, pressing it will return you to the weather menu.
